# Hello! 

My name's Cian, I'm just starting out with Unity 3D, I've got a background in Graphic Design so I'm familiar with a lot of design stuff and some basic HTML coding (try not to laugh).

I'm just getting started with C# and might have a few questions along the way. I'd love to use my skills in order to make stuff for VR, it's an area that I find very very interesting, and I can't wait to dive further into it :)
